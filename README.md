# BE practice: node with ts, api, databases

## Useful commands:

- `npm run dev` to start the project locally - the script will automatically start nodemon which will recompile every time you save - no need to re-start the server on every change!
- `tsc -w` to keep typescript in watch mode and save whatever changes you make to the ts files. if you don't do that, the js file won't recognise any changes and won't compile.

next steps:

- add connection to free remote relational db instance (render) :white_check_mark:
- add prisma :white_check_mark: https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/introduction/what-is-prisma
- add models
- add routes
- test them
